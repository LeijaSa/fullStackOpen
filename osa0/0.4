    Note right of browser: After the browser has loaded the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file, it starts running the JavaScript code. This JavaScript code is responsible for making a request to the server to fetch the JSON data containing the notes.
    
    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server    

    Note right of browser: After receiving the JSON response (which contains the list of notes), the browser runs a callback function. This function takes the JSON data and renders it on the webpage, displaying the notes for the user.
